Install Python 2.7 :https://www.python.org/downloads/ and Pygame :http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml first :)

Using arrows on the keyboard to move and attack.   
Have fun !!!

Here is some hints:
1.At the beginning of the game, key is not that important.
2.slime =  attack, skeleton =  defense, Royal guard = "something else". Boss = U win
3.HP and yellow key will make sure you stand in stage 4
4.When the final red head boss killed, the game is over.
